A few days after Christmas 2017 our world collapsed. Bev, my partner and my sonâ€™s mummy died very suddenly. Tam saw his mammy go from holding his hand and cuddling him to me performing CPR and the next day seeing her for the last time. This blog is a bit of our journey, struggles and successes. I hope that if you invest your time in reading it that you get something from it and hopefully in some way it helps you.

Tam was diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum in 2009. He is a bright, mischevious boy who loves cuddles and tickle fights. I am still not sure exactly what he understands about his mammy dieing. He still continually asks for her. 

I am now a full time Dad, and I cannot see that ever changing as Tam needs all of the physical, emotional and love energy that I have.

Alan and Tam
