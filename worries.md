It's 3:30 in the morning and Tam is busy on the computer recording himself reading into the computer. Once he is finished we play it back and read the book together with the recording playing. We then work on the word he does not read clearly.

In the meantime I am sitting behind him and planning out the rest of the week. Basically shopping and entertainment. The shopping is the hardest part as with a bad shoulder it is limiting what I can carry. Even taking that into consideration I have one more worry.

In some ways it's a strange worry but it's a worry all the same. What's the worry? Well it's the pubs open on Saturday. I don't drink so why is it a worry? For one I just feel it's going to put a massive strain on the NHS when it should be allowed to catch it's breath. Secondly I think we have all seen a minority of people who have found it difficult to behave sensibly during locksown. Now add alcohol into the mix. All I see is disaster.

Living in town it is always noticeable at the weekend an increase in the number of sirens blaring from emergency vehicles. Plus if you have ever had the misfortune of visiting A&E over the weekend it feels like a disgusting self inflicted war zone. Add Covid-19 into that mix and boom.

So my planning for me and Tam is to stay out of town over the weekend. Let the stupidity be its own company.

Stay safe

Alan & Tam
